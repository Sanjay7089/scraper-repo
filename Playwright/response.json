Many of them are described like a computer program with many \\u201cif/then\\u201d statements. However, when you find the applicable \\\"if\\\" statements you can see who gets how much of the money. For example:\\n\\n\\u2022 If only a surviving spouse survives the reported owner, that spouse gets 100% of the unclaimed property.\\n\\n\\u2022 If only the children survive the reported owner, they get 100% of the unclaimed property, split equally among them.\\n\\n\\u2022 If both a spouse and children of the reported owner survive:\\n\\n\\u2022 if all the children are also children of the surviving spouse, that surviving spouse gets 100% of the unclaimed property.\\n\\n\\u2022 if any of those children are children of a person other than the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse gets half of the unclaimed property; all the children of the reported owner that are not children of the surviving spouse equally split the other half.\\n\\n\\u2022 If only the parent(s) of the reported owner survive, the parent(s) get 100% of the unclaimed property.\\n\\n\\u2022 If neither spouse, nor issue, nor parents survive the reported owner, the unclaimed property goes (in the order listed) to: (1) brother(s) & sister(s) or their issue; (2) the grandparents or their issue.\\n\\nAs always, we recommend you submit your claim online with any supporting documentation you have to help us validate your right to the money.
